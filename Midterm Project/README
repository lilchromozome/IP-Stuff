Interesting aspects of implementation

William started working on the project first, so he did a great job defining functions and creating an outline 
for the project. He worked through many of the implementations, which Bryce continued. We worked together 
on some functions (W, V, S, etc) so we understood how they worked and how to approach the problems, and Bryce 
finished most of the implementations. William did a lot of work with gbd debugging, and Bryce assisted fixing 
memory leaks / ensuring that the code passed all of the tests (test01 through test11).

The most difficult / interesting aspect of the project was the V (solve) command. However, we took a lot of inspiration 
from homework 3 in the sense that we created a handle_V_command function that called a recursive V_helper function which
 continuously recursively called itself until a solution was found. This was particularly interesting since it took a 
 strong breadth-first search technique to brute-force the solution of the 3x3 tile game. This was interesting since 
 it seemed inefficient, but after a bit of toying around with alternative approaches that may optimize the V command 
 such as A* search with a Manhattan distance heuristic, we decided that it wasn't worth the hassle of optimizing it 
 when it already worked (especially since the spec of the assignment said our original approach was correct). This was a 
 very interesting command to implement, and it would be very interesting to see how it looked if it could solve the problem optimally!
