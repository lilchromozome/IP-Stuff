read_file: this function uses a for loop and fscanf to get each line of the 
input file until there are no more lines or if there is an error reading
the input file.

match: 
1. Check if there is a * after current 
    -let the first term match of regex the match with charactes on word until no match
    -if it is wrong, recursive backtracking and try skipping current 'a*' term
        -In case there are repeat regex terms like "a*a*a*a*a", it would still match "a"
2. else Check if there is a ? after current term
    -let the first term match of regex the first match on word
    -if it is wrong, recursive backtracking and try skipping current 'a?' term
3. else Check if term is ~
    -for loop until there is a match or end of restriction
4. else check if the current term in word and regex match
    -next character in word and regex
5. else, no match return 0

main:
- First checks how many outputs to assign restriction and read the given file
- Loop to collect the regex from the user and sift through the array that 
    contains all the words from the file to match the regex
